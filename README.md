This is a clone of Whatsapp, made with React Native and Firebase & Tailwind.

## Installation

    ```bash
    npm install
    # To install all the dependencies
    ```

    ```bash

npx expo start

# To start the expo server

    ```

## Usage

I have removed the firebase config file, so you will have to add your own firebase config file in the firebase.js file.
