This is a clone of Whatsapp, made with React Native and Firebase & Tailwind.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies and then run the development server:

```bash
npm install
# then
npx expo start
# then
scan the QR code with your phone or open it with an emulator
```

## Usage

I have removed the firebase config file, so you will have to add your own firebase config file in the firebase.js file.

## Contributing
